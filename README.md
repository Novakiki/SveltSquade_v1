# Svelte 5 Experts - Multi-Agent Development Template

This template provides a structure for multi-agent collaborative development using three specialized Svelte 5 expert agents. While the structure can be adapted for other technologies, the agents are specifically configured for Svelte 5 development using native web capabilities.

## Specializations

This template's agents are specialized in:
- Pure Svelte 5 development
- Native web APIs and capabilities
- Modern state management with runes
- Built-in store implementations
- Component architecture best practices

## Agent Roles

1. Agent-1 (Svelte 5 Frontend Expert):
   - Pure Svelte 5 UI implementation
   - Runes and stores architecture
   - Native web visualization (SVG/Canvas)
   - Component pattern design

2. Agent-2 (Svelte 5 Full Stack Expert):
   - Svelte 5 state management
   - Native storage solutions
   - Type-safe implementations
   - Performance optimization

3. Agent-3 (Svelte 5 Technical Advisor):
   - Svelte 5 best practices research
   - Web standards compatibility
   - Pattern recommendations
   - Technical architecture guidance

## Setup Instructions

1. Project Initialization:
   - Copy the template to your Svelte 5 project directory
   - Follow tasks in `state/tasks.json` starting with "project-initialization"
   - Update project_state.json with your Svelte 5 project details

2. Agent Communication Setup:
   - Create empty agent_1.txt, agent_2.txt, and agent_3.txt files
   - Set appropriate file permissions
   - Create message files from template_messages.json

3. Custom Configuration:
   - Update agent capabilities for your specific Svelte 5 needs
   - Modify agent rules if needed
   - Configure technical stack in project_state.json
   - Define project-specific tasks

## Usage

1. Initialize the project following the tasks in tasks.json
2. Agents communicate through their respective .txt files
3. Project state is tracked in project_state.json
4. Task progress is managed in tasks.json
5. Communication history is stored in messages/

## Customization

While the agents are specialized in Svelte 5, you can customize:
- Specific Svelte 5 features to focus on
- Project architecture preferences
- State management patterns
- Component design approaches
- Testing and optimization strategies

## Getting Started

1. Copy template files to your Svelte 5 project
2. Run through initialization tasks
3. Configure project-specific settings
4. Begin development with expert agent collaboration

## Template Adaptation

While this template is optimized for Svelte 5 development, the structure can be adapted for other technologies by:
1. Modifying agent capabilities in config/*.json
2. Updating agent rules in .cursor/rules/
3. Adjusting task structure in tasks.json
4. Reconfiguring project state in project_state.json
